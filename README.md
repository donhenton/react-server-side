## Application Description 

This is a simple demonstration of React server side rendering based on code
from React Design Patterns and Best Practices from PacktPub, authored by Michele Bertoli.

It illustrates the idea that server side rendering creates a non functional 
html version of the app which is 'overlayed' on the html/code from the client
version of the app.
