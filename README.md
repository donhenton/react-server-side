## Application Description 

This is a simple demonstration of React server side rendering based on code
from __React Design Patterns and Best Practices from PacktPub__, authored by Michele Bertoli.

It illustrates the idea that server side rendering creates a non functional 
html version of the app which is 'overlayed' on the html/code from the client
version of the app.
